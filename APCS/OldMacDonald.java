/* Ruijing Li
 * Period 3
 * 2/1/14
 * Time Spent: 40 minutes
 * This was a easy and unchallenging lab. The website gives 
 * almost all the code for you. The only problem I had was 
 * forgetting to import java.util and remembering that 
 * a unintialized string is null not just empty. Other than
 * that it was a nice easy lab.
